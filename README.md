# HW2: Lucas-Kanade Tracking

In this homework for CMU's Advanced CV course, I implemented template tracking using the Lucas Kanade tracking method.

A brief description of the method follows
  - The algorithm works on two images. One image is the template $\mathcal{T}$ and one the image $\mathcal{I}$
  - Calculate the gradients of either the template or the image based on the variant of the algorithm being run
  - Calculate an ideal warp that reduced the error between both images using a gradient descent algorithm
